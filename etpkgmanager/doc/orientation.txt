There should exist a set of installers and patches on one or more servers that
are reachable by the client.  The installers may be used to install the
software initially, but all files [^af] that may potentially be installed on a
client machine should be cataloged and cached.  This is true 

There may be multiple caches, from the central (manufacturer's) comprehensive
cache, to a cache server onsite at a client's location, to local caches on the
individual client machines.  The clients may query each other to find
components, and if found, may delete them from it's own cache to save space.

The central cache should be comprehensive.  It should contain every component
released by a software manufacturer.  The system caches will be less complete,
and the client caches will be least complete.  When looking for a component,
it is expected that the local caches will be contacted first, then the system
caches, and finally a central cache.
