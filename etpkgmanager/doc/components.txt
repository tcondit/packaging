What is a component?

A component is a known (released) file that is identified uniquely identified
by it's SHA-1 hexdigest.  Each application which contains the component
assigns it's own GUID to the component.

The hexdigest is calculated from hashing the contents of the file itself.  The
GUID is independent of the file and its contents, and is used as a reference
to the file, in lieu of a filename.  The reason for this is that the same file
(or at least a file with the exact same contents) may be used in multiple
different places within an application, without having to track the file
according to its path relative to the application root.

Each application that installs the same component (again, shorthand for a file
with possibly variable names, but with exactly the same content) will refer to
the file by a different GUID.  Where this gets weird is that while the GUID is
different, the hexdigest is identical.  In other words, when referring to the
component itself, the hexdigest is the right way to identify it.  When
referring to the component on a particular product install, the GUID and
hexdigest uniquely identifies it.

Again: there is only one hexdigest for a specific file regardless of the
file's name or where it's installed (including in different applications), but
each application will refer to the file by a different GUID.  This ensures
that the file may be administered separately across applications but still
refer to the same file where appropriate.
